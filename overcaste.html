      <h3><strong>OVERCASTE</strong></h3>
      <p>Overcaste is a 3D adventure game about a sand-shifter protecting her home from futuristic
        invading forces. The game is all about brisk and fluid movement through beautiful desert environments, featuring
        surreal boss battles against monolithic alien oppressors. I was the UI/UX designer from January of 2022 to
        December of 2023.</p>

          <h5>UI prototyping and testing</h5>
          <p>I came into the Overcaste team following my time in Personal Eyes, where the mid-2000s visual theme
            dictated the UI art. Overcaste, on the other hand, was not as mature in its art direction. I started by
            designing Overcaste's UI with strong visuals first, but progress was slow because our visual language didn't
            exist yet.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Then I had a meeting with a mentor who introduced me to the value of designing the User
            Experience before even thinking of the User Interface. After that, I pivoted to completing the necessary
            interactions and info presentation with simple shapes, and adjusting them based on playtest feedback. This
            way of working made iteration much faster.</p>

          <h5>Working with a professional artist</h5>
          <p>The most exciting part of Overcaste was working with our team's illustrator. We concepted ideas together
            and once his art assets were complete, I found ways to animate them in the engine. Some of these assets
            were
            static images I had to squash and stretch. Others were animated, and I created materials in Unreal
            to flip through the frames of the animation.</p>

        <p>Overcaste is being developed with Unreal Engine 4.</p>
