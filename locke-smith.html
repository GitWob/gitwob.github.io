      <h3><strong>Locke Smith</strong></h3>
      <p>Locke Smith was the product of a game jam in my second year at RIT. It ended up being the largest project I had worked on to date, and my first experience working on a project start-to-finish in a 3D game engine. The team was also the largest I had worked with at the time- I had three teammates with more specialized roles.</p>

      <h5>Visual direction</h5>
      <p>I selected all the game's fonts and color choices to create a theme for all the 2D art and UI.</p>
      <h5>UI/UX</h5>
      <p>I set up the title screen with the introduction animation. I also designed and programmed all the menus seen in-game, and wrote the functionality for the settings menu.</p>
      <h5>Optimization</h5>
      <p>Another thing I'm proud of in Locke Smith was some optimizations I made to the 3D assets. For example, the floor was made of a large grid of individual mesh tiles, and this made collisions with the floor very demanding to calculate. I replaced the floors' collision meshes with one big plane, and increased performance a lot without disturbing any of the level designer's visible architecture.</p>
      <h5>What we used</h5>
      <p>Locke Smith was built in Unity.</p>
