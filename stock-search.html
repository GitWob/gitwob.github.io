      <h3><strong>STOCK SEARCH</strong></h3>
      <p>Stock Search! You are in the soup store, searching for stock- but the
        soup store is almost out of stock. You have a large machine gun with no stock, so it kicks you back a lot when
        you fire it. This game was created during a weekend for RIT Game Dev Club's Summer Game Jam. (The theme of the
        jam was "Out of Stock")</p>

      <h5>Art</h5>
      <p>I drew the character, their machine gun, the soup stock, a bullet casing, and a flash for the bullet trail.</p>
      <h5>Mentorship</h5>
      <p>The experience gap on this project was big. Two members of our four-person team were first-time game jammers.
        We weren't all game design majors, either. I shared lessons from my experience making games, and made sure we
        avoided a lot of rookie mistakes with version control, but I also wanted to listen to our beginners
        and let them do valuable work. I helped them find the resources and information they needed to start building
        the game, and helped them identify their strengths. In the end, I barely wrote a line of code for this
        fully-functional game, and I am so proud of that! Our team pulled together to learn fast and try new
        things.</p>
      <h5>What we used</h5>
      <p>Stock Search! was built using Unity. I used Sketches Pro, Krita, and GIMP for the art. We also got an
        illustration
        for our background from another artist, Vigorousjammer. The full credits are on our Itch.io page listed above.
