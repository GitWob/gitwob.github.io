      <h3><strong>PERSONAL EYES</strong></h3>
      <p>Personal Eyes is an indie survival horror game inspired by classic horror games of the PS2 era. It progressed
        through 3 cycles of development in 9 months:</p>
      <bl>
        <li>As an independent project in the Summer of 2021 (I worked part-time).</li>
        <li>Selected for the MAGIC Maker: Prototype Edition program in the Fall of 2021 (I worked part-time).</li>
        <li>Entered the full MAGIC Maker program in the Spring of 2022 (I worked full-time).</li>
      </bl>
      <br>
      <p>Personal Eyes has received funding and mentorship from RIT's MAGIC Center, as well as mentorship from several
        developers at Rockstar Games. It was published in May of 2022 along with a postmortem featuring a Q&A with the
        game's developers.</p>

        <p>Our keypad pop-up.</p>

      <div class="grid">

        <p>A cross-section of the layers of the buttons on the keypad. There are several composited textures taken from photographs on Textures.com, and other details are hand-drawn.</p>

      <div class="grid">
        <img src="media/tutorial.png">
        <p>I set up tutorial prefabs so the level designer could place
          tutorial pop-ups with custom text anywhere on the map.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid">
        <img src="media/ui-pieces.png">
        <p>Art I created for our main menu, pause menu, and in-game pop-ups and prompts.<br>Also stars for one of my particle systems.</p>

      <div class="grid">
        <img src="media/phone.png">
        <p>Our player character's flip-phone, which acts as a health bar and inventory screen.</p>

        <p>Samples and cross-sections of the art created for the flip-phone UI.<br>This includes some unused assets from
          the time when the player character would find a dagger and a sword.</p>

      <h5>UI conceptualization and iteration</h5>
      <p>Personal Eyes evolved through a wide variety of visual identities. I had to design and redesign to keep the UI
        style in line with our art direction. As my longest-term project to date, I had the opportunity to iterate and
        refine ideas based on feedback from our artists, players, and industry mentors. It was absolutely a privilege to
        see that process firsthand, even if it meant my work had to be revised all the time.</p>
      <h5>UI implementation and tech art</h5>
      <p>I was also responsible for the scripting and implementation of UI systems in game. This ranges from main menus
        and tutorial pop-ups to real-time HUD pieces like the player's inventory and ammo counter. I used Unity's
        particle system and the Shader Graph system to create effects. Later, I created more effects with Universal Render Pipeline settings.</p>
      <h5>What we used</h5>
      <p>Personal Eyes is built in Unity. I used Krita to draw and edit sprites for the UI. I also used
        Axure RP to mockup UI elements to help our art director make visual decisions.
